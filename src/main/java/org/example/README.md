problem1: This class solves the problem of finding the minimum element in an array. It implements a recursive function minimum that finds the minimum element in the array.
problem1_alternative: Similar to the previous class but without using an array. It also finds the minimum element, but numbers are input sequentially without prior storage in an array.
problem2: This class calculates the average of elements in an array.
problem2_alternative: Similar to the previous class but without using an array.
problem3: This class determines whether a number is prime or composite.
problem4: Computes the factorial of a number.
problem5: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
problem6: Raises a number to a power.
problem7: Generates all permutations of a given string.
problem8: Checks if a string consists only of digits.
problem9: Calculates the binomial coefficient.
problem10: Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
All classes except Main contain a main method, which serves as the entry point for each of the tasks.
